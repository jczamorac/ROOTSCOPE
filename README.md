# ROOTSCOPE
A CERN ROOT GUI application for making analysis easier

Dear ROOTer,
This is a script for generic data analysis via powerful CERN ROOT.
It helps you get your analysis done faster and easier.

Some of my favorite features:
* more intuitive way to zoom in/out a 1D/2D histogram (TH1 or TH2)
* rebin/undo rebin, and you can still keep the original histogram.
* singe/double Gaussian fit with bg setting.
* put mutiple histograms side-by-side and switch them is a piece of key.


One can find the instruction in ROOTSCOPE_manual.pdf 
or short video demonstrations: <br>
