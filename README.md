# ROOTSCOPE
A CERN ROOT GUI application for making analysis easier. <br>

Dear ROOTer, <br>
This is a script for generic data analysis via powerful CERN ROOT. <br>
It helps you get your analysis done faster and easier.<br>

Some of my favorite features:<br>
* more intuitive way to zoom in/out a 1D/2D histogram (TH1 or TH2)<br>
* rebin/undo rebin, and you can still keep the original histogram.<br>
* singe/double Gaussian fit with bg setting.<br>
* put mutiple histograms side-by-side and switch them is a piece of key.<br>


One can find the instruction in ROOTSCOPE_manual.pdf 
or short video demonstrations: <br>
