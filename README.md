# ROOTSCOPE
A CERN ROOT GUI application for making analysis easier. <br>

Dear ROOTer, <br>
This is a GUI application for generic data analysis via powerful CERN ROOT. <br>

Some of my favorite features:<br>
* more intuitive way to zoom in/out a 1D/2D histogram (TH1 or TH2)<br>
* rebin/undo rebin, and you can still keep the original histogram.<br>
* singe/double Gaussian fit with bg setting.<br>
* put mutiple histograms side-by-side and switch them is a piece of key.<br>
